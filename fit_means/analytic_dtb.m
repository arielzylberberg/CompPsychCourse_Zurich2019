function D =  analytic_dtb(drift,t,Bup,yp,ny)
% D =  analytic_dtb(drift,t,Bup,yp,ny)
% Implementation of Cox & Miller (PDF of non-absorbed) and Ratcliff
% (probability absorbed and first passage time) analytic solutions to bounded
% drift diffusion (drift to bound). The solutions here handle flat but
% asymmetric bounds with delta function initiation anywhere between bounds.
%
% Input arguments
% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% drift         vector of drift rates
% t             time series or set of times in seconds (t(1) needs to be zero)
% Bup           scalar bounds with   Blo =-Bup (for asymmertric bounds
%               change yp instead
% yp            value of DV at t=0 (scalar) as a poprtion of Bup [i.e, -1 to +1]
% ny (optional) specifies the granularity (number of points) of  DV from [Blo,Bup]
%               and asks the function to return the unabsorbed probability distribution 
%               all times (will slow down simulation).
%
% Outputs
% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% Returns D, a structure (the first four have "lo" vesions too)
% D.up.p(drift)        probability of hitting the upper bound for each drift
% D.up.mean_t(drift)   mean decision time for upper bound for each drift level
% D.up.pdf_t(t,drift)  probability of upper bound hit at each time (sums to D.up)
% D.up.cdf_t(t,drift)  cumulative probability of upper bound hit at each time (ends at D.up)
%
% D.drifts             drifts tested
% D.bounds             bounds
% D.t                  times used for simulation
%
% if ny is passed then th:e function also returns:
% D.notabs.pdf(drifts,y,t) probability of being at y at time t
% D.notabs.pos_t(drifts,t) probability of not being absorbed and being >0
% D.notabs.neg_t(drifts,t) probability of not being absorbed and being <0
% D.notabs.y               the sets of y's considered for the pdf
